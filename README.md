# OWN GPT Using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Bedrock

## Description
I've harnessed the power of AWS Bedrock to create a versatile AI platform that delivers:
- üìù **Text Generation (Meta.llama2):** Engaging and coherent conversations like ChatGPT.
- üé® **Image Generation (Stability.AI's Stable Diffusion):** Stunning visuals from text prompts, inspired by MidJourney.
- üíª **Code Generation (Anthropic.claude):** Efficient code solutions, similar to CodeX.

Key technologies driving this project include Meta.llama2, Stability.AI's Stable Diffusion, and Anthropic.claude. I've developed a sleek web interface using Streamlit for easy public access.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains the following files:

- `imageGen.py`: Code for Image Generation.
- `textGen.py`: Code for Text Generation.
- `codeGen.py`: Code for Code Generation.
- `app.py`: Streamlit web application for user interaction.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
